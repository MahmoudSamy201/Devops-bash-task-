bash script for DevOps Task

1.Scripting task
Write a Bash shell or a python script which can:

● Process a text file which has users and their properties in each line.

● Determine one by one if the ID number of the user (last column) is odd or even number if it's specified.

● Check whether that user has a routable, FQDN email address.

● If so, write a message to stdout like: the $ID of $EMAIL is even|odd number.

● If the user has no valid email address OR user ID, the script should silently continue to the
next user.
